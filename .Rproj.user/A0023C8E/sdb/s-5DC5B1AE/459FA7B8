    "contents" : "Feature Selection \n=================\n\nThe features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. \n\nSubsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). \n\nFinally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). \n\nThese signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  \n'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.\n\ntBodyAcc-XYZ\ntGravityAcc-XYZ\ntBodyAccJerk-XYZ\ntBodyGyro-XYZ\ntBodyGyroJerk-XYZ\ntBodyAccMag\ntGravityAccMag\ntBodyAccJerkMag\ntBodyGyroMag\ntBodyGyroJerkMag\nfBodyAcc-XYZ\nfBodyAccJerk-XYZ\nfBodyGyro-XYZ\nfBodyAccMag\nfBodyAccJerkMag\nfBodyGyroMag\nfBodyGyroJerkMag\n\nThe set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: \n\nmean(): Mean value\nstd(): Standard deviation\nmad(): Median absolute deviation \nmax(): Largest value in array\nmin(): Smallest value in array\nsma(): Signal magnitude area\nenergy(): Energy measure.
