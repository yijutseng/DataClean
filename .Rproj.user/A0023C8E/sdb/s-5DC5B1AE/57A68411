Please check the following orginal feature inforamtion for deatail infromation of features.\n\nFor reporting the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. I use data.table package to merge all the measurements grouped by activiry label and subject.\n\n\n\n<h2> Original Feature Information</h2>\nFeature Selection \n=================\n\nThe features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. \n\nSubsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). \n\nFinally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). \n\nThese signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  \n'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.\n\ntBodyAcc-XYZ\ntGravityAcc-XYZ\ntBodyAccJerk-XYZ\ntBodyGyro-XYZ\ntBodyGyroJerk-XYZ\ntBodyAccMag\ntGravityAccMag\ntBodyAccJerkMag\ntBodyGyroMag\ntBodyGyroJerkMag\nfBodyAcc-XYZ\nfBodyAccJerk-XYZ\nfBodyGyro-XYZ\nfBodyAccMag\nfBodyAccJerkMag\nfBodyGyroMag\nfBodyGyroJerkMag\n\nThe set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: \n\nmean(): Mean value\nstd(): Standard deviation\nmad(): Median absolute deviation \nmax(): Largest value in array\nmin(): Smallest value in array\nsma(): Signal magnitude area\nenergy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. \niqr(): Interquartile range \nentropy(): Signal entropy\narCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4\ncorrelation(): correlation coefficient between two signals\nmaxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude\nmeanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency\nskewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal \nkurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal \nbandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.\nangle(): Angle between to vectors.\n\nAdditional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:\n\ngravityMean\ntBodyAccMean\ntBodyAccJerkMean\ntBodyGyroMean\ntBodyGyroJerkMean\n\nThe complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'\n",
